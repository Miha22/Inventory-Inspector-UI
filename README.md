# Inventory Inspector UI
Revolutionary plugin in my opinion, nothing similar was created before. UI-supported Plugin that manages player's inventory (add, remove items from player's inventory). UI asset can be found below:

## Features

UI is user-friendlyPlayers(with permission "rocket.invsee") can look into target player's inventory and if they have permission "rocket.invsee.edit" can edit inventoryPlugin supports background server player list and player inventory changes, that means if server player list or target player's inventory was changed during inspection, you will see the changeThere is also a help button - "?" I highly recommend you to click it at least once!I have provided Youtube video with my example how I interact with UIYou also will need UI itself to make plugin workIf player's inventory is full, extra items will be loaded to Cloud Inventory (each player on server should have cloud inventory access to get added items, permission -> "rocket.incloud" or "rocket.inc")

 
## Commands:

       /invsee: Opens a list of server players (/ins)
       /incloud: Opens your cloud inventory (/inc)

 
## Permissions:

       "rocket.incloud" to use /incloud or /inc
       "rocket.invsee" to use /invsee or /ins (WATCH + NO EDIT)
       "rocket.invsee.edit" to use /invsee or /ins (WATCH + EDIT)
